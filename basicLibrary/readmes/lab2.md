# Lab 02: Arrays, for loops, imports, ArrayLists
##Work done today
* Made a method that rolls a 6 sided dice and creates a random array that length is decided by a user input.
    * Wrote a test that test to see if the array is the correct length

* Wrote a method that checks for duplicates in an array
    * Wrote a test to make sure an array that has duplicates returns true

* Wrote a method calcAv that calculates the average of all elements in an array and returns a double
    * wrote a test that check to see if the method is averaging properly.
* Wrote a method that takes a 2d array, calls the calcAv method and then returns the lowest average of all of the arrays.
    * Wrote a test arrArrLowAvTest that tests if given an 2d array of ints will average them al and return the lowest average in a double
